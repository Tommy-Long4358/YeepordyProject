# YeepordyProject

This was a project created for BeachHacks Spring 2022. This project had its roots traced back to my days in AP Computer Science where my group and I made
a java project called "Yeepordy". The first draft of Yeepordy was made using a lot of copied and pasted code. It was revisited again during BeachHacks 2022 where
we started from scratch and used the Java FX API.
